<h1>The Best Movies According to Emily</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sound of Music</h3>
<p>It's just a classic. You need to see it at least once. Or in my case, 100 times. A musical, history, romance, comedy. It's just all around great, especially for the time it was made in. </p>

<h3>Cast Away</h3>
<p>Basically a one man show. This movie will make you love Tom Hanks if you don't already. You are drawn into the plot and cast take your eyes off until the credits.</p>

<h3>Cinderella-Disney Live Action</h3>
<p>No fluff, just a good movie. Re-Watched many times. </p>
